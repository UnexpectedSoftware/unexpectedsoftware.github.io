<h2>Introducing Cube Survivor: A Smash TV-Inspired Indie Mayhem</h2>
<p>Posted on August 7, 2025</p>
<p>Hey, arena warriors! This is Victor from Unexpected Software, kicking off with the first dev log for <strong>Cube Survivor</strong>—my love letter to Smash TV with a cubic twist. Check out this early gameplay screenshot:</p>

<p>This shot captures the heart of Cube Survivor: a top-down, twin-stick shooter where you battle waves of enemies in a shifting, cube-based arena. The blue grid and lab-like walls nod to a dystopian game show setting, while the swarm of foes—armed with guns and grenades—brings that classic Smash TV chaos. That score (00013471) shows the relentless action, and those green vials? They might be power-ups… or traps! I’m thrilled to be working on this with Rafael (<a href="https://github.com/Arkioner">https://github.com/Arkioner</a>), who’s bringing his skills to help shape this madness.</p>
<p>Core Mechanics So Far:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chaotic Combat</strong>: Dual-stick controls let you weave through enemy hordes, blasting with pixel-perfect precision.</li>
    <li><strong>Cube Dynamics</strong>: The arena’s cube walls can shift or explode, adding unpredictable cover and hazards.</li>
    <li><strong>Game Show Vibes</strong>: A snarky host (still in dev) will taunt you with mid-battle quips.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m building this in Unity, focusing on that frenetic feel, with Rafael. Next up: polishing the chaos and adding random events like cube avalanches. If you’re into retro arcade madness, sign up for updates or follow me on X. More screens and a demo soon!</p>
<p>Stay unexpected,<br>Victor</p>
